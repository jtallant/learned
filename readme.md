### The Random Show w/ Kevin Rose and Tim Ferriss
* If you rely on alcohol as social crutch, you won't get better at meeting new people
* Kevin says he started learning at night, I've been doing it in the morning but I think night is interesting because that would also keep you from drinking
* A large number of emergency room visits are from taking just a little too much Tylenol
* Coursera course called learning how to learn
* High correlation between **alcohol abuse** and **dementia**
* Find a way to truly take part in a cause by really getting involved. Use the skills you have.

### My own strategies for reducing alcohol intake
- **Push the first drink off as far as possible into the night**. In the best case, you just get really tired and go to bed without drinking. I usually have a hard time getting tired even if I got up early and worked out. If I push the first drink off late enough, it will at least make me a little tired. Sometimes I can stop at the one and go to sleep, other times I'll drink two more. I prefer to keep it at 2 or less though.
- **Have night time ritual**, like learning for one hour, reading, and having that tea with apple cider vinegar and organic raw honey before bed.
- **Track the number of drinks per day each day**. Just tracking it will reduce it.
- **Plan healthy activities on the weekend.** Example: plan to go to yoga or to a park on saturday or sunday morning, get a friend involved and get excited about it. This will make you a lot less likely to drink on friday night. If someone invites you out, there won't be a decision there, you already have plans.

### Things that have been working for me in regards to general improvement
- **Do less than you think you can**. Focus on consistency of healthy habits rather than duration. I've kept my workouts to 20 minutes and have seen a large increase in consecutive days worked out and number avg number of days per week worked out. I've also applied this to reading and learning.

## Juice generally isn't healthy
* Fruit juice is missing a lot of the stuff that makes whole fruit healthy
* liquid calories don't work the same way as calories from solid foods. When people add liquid calories to their diet, like apple juice, they don't compensate by eating less of other foods instead 
* sugary drinks are among the most fattening foods in existence. They don't contribute to fullness, making us eat more overall
* Eat Whole Fruit, But Skip the Juice, it's not healthy

# The Random Show w/ Kevin Rose and Tim Ferriss
## August 22nd 2018

### Random
* If you rely on alcohol as social crutch, you won't get better at meeting new people
* Kevin says he started learning at night, I've been doing it in the morning but I think night is interesting because that would also keep you from drinking
* A large number of emergency room visits are from taking just a little too much Tylenol
* Coursera course called learning how to learn
* High correlation between **alcohol abuse** and **dementia**
* Find a way to truly take part in a cause by really getting involved. Use the skills you have.

### My own strategies for reducing alcohol intake
- **Push the first drink off as far as possible into the night**. In the best case, you just get really tired and go to bed without drinking. I usually have a hard time getting tired even if I got up early and worked out. If I push the first drink off late enough, it will at least make me a little tired. Sometimes I can stop at the one and go to sleep, other times I'll drink two more. I prefer to keep it at 2 or less though.
- **Have night time ritual**, like learning for one hour, reading, and having that tea with apple cider vinegar and organic raw honey before bed.
- **Track the number of drinks per day each day**. Just tracking it will reduce it.
- **Plan healthy activities on the weekend.** Example: plan to go to yoga or to a park on saturday or sunday morning, get a friend involved and get excited about it. This will make you a lot less likely to drink on friday night. If someone invites you out, there won't be a decision there, you already have plans.

### Things that have been working for me in regards to general improvement
- **Do less than you think you can**. Focus on consistency of healthy habits rather than duration. I've kept my workouts to 20 minutes and have seen a large increase in consecutive days worked out and number avg number of days per week worked out. I've also applied this to reading and learning.

# Juice generally isn't healthy
* Fruit juice is missing a lot of the stuff that makes whole fruit healthy
* liquid calories don't work the same way as calories from solid foods. When people add liquid calories to their diet, like apple juice, they don't compensate by eating less of other foods instead 
* sugary drinks are among the most fattening foods in existence. They don't contribute to fullness, making us eat more overall
* Eat Whole Fruit, But Skip the Juice, it's not healthy

# Habits - James Clear

* Your habits determine your future
    - career
    - health
    - happiness
    - money
    - skills
* Aggregation of marginal gains
    - Ties back to "do less than you think you can"
    - marginal gains can stack and grow exponentially over time
    - Start small
* Goals and repititions get you to any outcome that you want
    - Don't focus on how long it takes
    - Commit to the **system** and put in the reps
    - Good things will happen
* How long for a habit to stick?
    - 66 days+
    - Habits take months to build. Keep this in mind.
* Behavior Automoticity
    - How little you have to think about something
    - The more automatic, the more it is a habit
* Anatomy of a Habit
    - Trigger => Action => Reward
    - Trigger: Reminds you to do something
    - Action: The thing you do
    - Reward: The benefit you get and feel
* How to build habits    
    - start with an extremely easy habit
    - increase the habit in a very small way
    - keep it easy, break the habit down as needed
* Example
    - 2 minute picking exercise on guitar everyday right after lunch smoothie
    - Increase to two 2 minute exercises after 1 week
    - Increase to three 2 minute exercises after 2 weeks
* Triggers
    - cold trigger, tells you to do something but you can't right now
    - hot trigger, triggers to do something you can do right now
    - preceding event (PE), something that happens right before the habit
    - PE is a habit itself, use one you already have to build another
* 5 trigger types
    - Time (should happen by certain time, weekly, daily, etc.)
    - Location (at gym = workout)
    - Preceding Event (an event that triggers some other action)
    - Emotional State (triggers response, this is a habit)
    - Other People (people you are have huge impact on habits and behavior)
* Stacking habit onto existing habit 
    - neurons that fire together wire together
    - find things that you do everyday and pick one to stack habit onto
    - example: meditate for 60 seconds after morning coffee
    - rely on motivation and willpower as least as possible
    - example: lay running shoes out day before
    - if the habit is hard enough you could possibly not feel motivated..
    - the habit is too hard, decrease it, has to be super easy

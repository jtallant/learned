### The Random Show w/ Kevin Rose and Tim Ferriss
* If you rely on alcohol as social crutch, you won't get better at meeting new people
* Kevin says he started learning at night, I've been doing it in the morning but I think night is interesting because that would also keep you from drinking
* A large number of emergency room visits are from taking just a little too much Tylenol
* Coursera course called learning how to learn
* High correlation between **alcohol abuse** and **dementia**

### My own strategies for reducing alcohol intake
* Push the first drink off as far as possible into the night. In the best case, you just get really tired and go to bed without drinking. I usually have a hard time getting tired even if I got up early and worked out. If I push the first drink off late enough, it will at least make me a little tired. Sometimes I can stop at the one and go to sleep, other times I'll drink two more. I prefer to keep it at 2 or less though.
* Have night time ritual, like learning for one hour, reading, and having that tea with apple cider vinegar and organic raw honey before bed.
* Track the number of drinks per day each day. Just tracking it will reduce it.
